# Halcyonsim

Halcyon World is a Virtual World with a full 3D environment,  written in C Sharp (C#), where you may move about with a character known as an avatar in a 3D World accessed with a 3D Graphics Application, commonly known as a "Viewer," the most common of which is the Firestorm Viewer. It allows users "talk" to other people in-world through Nearby Chat, IM's, Group Chats and Group IM's and in voice, usually. (Depending on the voice service available.)  Although that's as much like a game as it gets. There is also the ability to build objects in-world known as primatives or prims in various shapes and sizes to make different types of 3D objects. 

Halcyon World was a fork from the OpenSimlator Project in 2010.


For example, <a href="https://SovariaEstates.world" target="_blank">Sovaria Estates</a>  runs on the Halcyon simulator. Halcyon is different and incompatible with both Second LifeÂ© and OpenSims, but we can use the OpenSim viewers (FirestormOS recommended). Halcyon has a better physics, better script engine, more prims, free upload(depending on each world's setting), and a more powerful asset database (NOT a cloud). As a proof, the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_QnNH-xDPyg" target="_blank">train</a> in Welcome region has no equivalent in any of the SL or OS worlds. Halcyon is intended for anybody to run their own world, and there already are several, with projects of inter-worlds communication.  But this needs to restart the development of Halcyon, which has been very slow since the end of InWorldz.  A project which is today coming to fruition is Mundos Market, which will allow merchants to sell in all connected Halcyon Worlds.



We welcome developers who know C Sharp to join us in maintaining and improving Halcyon World. 

Thank you.
