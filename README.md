# HalcyonSim

Simulates a virtual world environment. With sun, moon, clouds, land, buildings *(objects with seamless textures to give the desired look)*, avatars.. and interactive objects that are scripted.

HalcyonGrid or HalcyonSim was a fork from the <a href="http://opensimulator.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >OpenSimulator</a> Project in 2010, 

## Virtual World where people may move about in a full 3D world.

Halcyon World is a Virtual World with a full 3D environment,  written in C Sharp (C#), where you may move about with a character known as an avatar in a 3D World accessed with a 3D Graphics Application, commonly known as a "Viewer," which is used to access these virtual worlds. (not a VR headset) such as the most common one, <a href="https://firestormviewer.org" target="_blank" rel="follow">FirestormOS</a>.  *(the "OS" standing for OpenSim, and not Operating System)* also it is similar to <a href="https://SecondLife.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >Second Life®</a>.  It allows users "talk" to other people in-world through nearby chat, IM's, group chats and group IM's and sometimes in voice, depending on how the grid is setup and the permissions set on individual regions. Although that's as much like a game as it gets. There is also the ability to build objects in-world known as primatives or prims in various shapes and sizes to make different types of 3D objects. Additionally other 3D items known as "Mesh" (DEA files) can be imported which have been created/edited with a 3D object editor/creator such as the free program <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365670/Blender/" target="_blank" rel="follow" >"Blender"</a>.

Halcyon is different and incompatible with both Second Life© and OpenSims, but we can use the OpenSim viewers <a href="https://firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/" target="_blank" rel="follow" >FirestormOS</a> recommended). Halcyon has a better physics, better script engine, more prims, free upload(depending on each world's setting), and a more powerful asset database (NOT a "cloud" ... *there is no "cloud" only somebody else's computer*). As a proof, this <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_QnNH-xDPyg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tram</a> has no equivalent in any of the SL or OS worlds. Halcyon is intended for anybody to run their own world, and there already are several, with projects of inter-worlds communication.  But this needs to restart the development of Halcyon, which has been very slow since the end of InWorldz.  A project which is today coming to fruition is Mundos Market, which will allow merchants to sell in all connected Halcyon Worlds.



### We welcome developers who know C Sharp to join us in maintaining and improving Halcyon World. 

Thank you.
